Thonburian Whisper is an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) in Thai fine-tuned using [Whisper](https://openai.com/blog/whisper/) model
originally from OpenAI. The model is released as a part of [Whisper fine-tuning event](https://github.com/huggingface/community-events/tree/main/whisper-fine-tuning-event) from Huggingface (December 2022). We trained the model using [Commonvoice](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/th) 11, [Gowajee corpus](https://github.com/ekapolc/gowajee_corpus), and [Thai Elderly Speech dataset](https://github.com/VISAI-DATAWOW/Thai-Elderly-Speech-dataset/releases/tag/v1.0.0).

## Usage

Use the model with [Hugginface's transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) as follows:

```py
import torch
from transformers import pipeline

MODEL_NAME = "biodatlab/whisper-th-medium-combined"
lang = "th"

device = 0 if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"

pipe = pipeline(
    task="automatic-speech-recognition",
    model=MODEL_NAME,
    chunk_length_s=30,
    device=device,
)

pipe.model.config.forced_decoder_ids = pipe.tokenizer.get_decoder_prompt_ids(
    language=lang, task="transcribe"
)
pipe("audio.mp3", ignore_warning=True)["text"] # perform ASR with created pipe
```

## Requirements

Use `pip` to install the requirements as follows:

``` sh
!pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers
!pip install librosa
!sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

## Model performance

We measure word error rate (WER) of the model with [deepcut tokenizer](https://github.com/rkcosmos/deepcut) after punctuation removal and replaing maiyamok (à¹†) with the preceding word.

| **Model**            | **WER (Commonvoice 11)** |
|----------------------|--------------------------|
| Whisper CV11 (medium)     |  -                  |
| Whisper combined (medium) |  **9.17**           |

_CV11_ means the model is trained on Commonvoice 11 dataset only. _Combined_ means Whisper is fine-tuned with combined dataset.
The splitting is based on original splitting from [`datasets`](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/index).

**Inference time** We tested inference on 1000 files with average time per file of 5 seconds.
[Wav2vec-XLSR](https://huggingface.co/airesearch/wav2vec2-large-xlsr-53-th) takes ~ 0.054 sec/file and Whisper (medium) takes ~ 1. sec/file.
